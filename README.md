# resume-to-job-checker
A personal project where I have used an LLM to create an AI application that compare a list of CVs against a Job Description using two different methods.
- calculates similarity scores between a job description and a list of CVs using embeddings generated by a language model.
- prompt-based scoring using an open-source model that supports prompt interactions to compare the skills, qualifications, and experiences listed in the CV with those required in the job description.
